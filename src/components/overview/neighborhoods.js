    "Bushwick": "Edgy and increasingly hip, Bushwick is an evolving, industrial area marked by imaginative street art and converted warehouses that are home to artist studios and artisanal coffee shops. Dining options span the globe, and avant-garde nightlife thrives in clubs like performance space House of Yes and quirky bars with vintage, mismatched furnishings. A few pocket parks are shaded by mature trees and have playgrounds",
    "Bedford Stuyvesant": "Bedford-Stuyvesant, commonly called Bed-Stuy, has been a center of African-American culture since the early 20th century, home to cultural icons from Jackie Robinson to Jay-Z. Ornate 19th-century townhouses fill the area, with indie boutiques on Tompkins Place. French bistros, Southern comfort food, and Caribbean fare define the dining scene, while diverse crowds fill hip, cozy bars, many with live music",
    "Clinton Hill": "The Hill, as the general area was known – with a maximum elevation of 95 feet (29 m), the highest in the area – was believed to have health benefits because many people believed that disease was more prevalent in low-lying areas. The area is named after Clinton Avenue, which in turn was named in honor of New York Governor DeWitt Clinton (1769–1828). The main thoroughfare is DeKalb Avenue. The affluent neighborhood's mixture of apartment buildings, mansions, brownstone and brick rowhouses, and the Pratt Institute and St. Joseph's College, built at various times in a number of different styles, is a great part of its charm."
